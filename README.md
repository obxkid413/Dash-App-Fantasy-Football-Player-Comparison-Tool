# Dash-App-Fantasy-Football-Player-Comparison-Tool

This app uses 2017 fantasy football data and allows for comparisons between players.  It also displays summary statistics for those players for the 2017/18 NFL season. It is really an extension of the fantasy football data code whereby I scraped the data from the web and made a simple plot in Bokeh.  This is using that same data but just allowing much more interactivity with Dash.
